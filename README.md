# See Colors (In Development)

**See Colors** is a cross-platform mobile app that adjusts images for color blindness. Users upload a photo, and the app transforms its colors for better visibility.

For the effectiveness of the daltonization algorithm used in this project, see my [Daltonize API documentation](https://github.com/MelvinDinh3302/daltonize-api#demonstration).

## Features

- **Advanced Algorithm**: Powered by a Flask backend with optimized daltonization.
- **High Performance**: Handles large image uploads smoothly.
- **Easy Comparison**: Side-by-side before/after view.
- **Simple Interface**: Clean and minimalist UI.

## TODO

- Add camera functionality.
- Improve app styling.
