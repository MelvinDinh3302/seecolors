**See Colors** is a cross-platform mobile app designed to enhance image visibility for users with color blindness. Simply take or upload a photo, and the app transforms its colors for better visibility.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues

- Android 13+: Due to scoped storage changes, Expo MediaLibrary must request access to **images, videos, and audio** even though the app only handles photos. This may lead to misleading permission prompts.
- iOS (Limited Photo Access): If the app is granted only limited access to the photo library, the save animation may not appear, even though the image is still saved successfully.
